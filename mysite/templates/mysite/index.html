	<h1>About the data</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		This website estimates the covid cases/100k for vaccinated and unvaccinated people of different ages in Marin. Marin HHS provides the cases per day for each age group. This website estimates the percent of vaccinated and unvaccinated cases by using data from California HHS and adjusting it for the vaccination rate in Marin. These graphs do not represent what actually happened; they just estimate the risk by vaccination status. The calculations assume vaccination rates are the same for all people eligible for the vaccine, which isn’t true. The unvaccinated case rate is very high because they make up a small percent of the population but the majority of covid cases.

	<p>
		Calculating the percent of cases in Marin from vaccinated people used the formula: percent of Marin population
		that is vaccinated * percent of cases in California from vaccinated people/percent of Californians who are
		vaccinated.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Note</b> the graphs are scaled differently based on how best to present the data so data may be distorted. At
		the end, there is a graph comparing covid cases/100k for all vaccinated people and ages 0-4 because they can’t
		get vaccinated. It is kind of messy.

	<h1>Addition about hospitalizations and deaths in California</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		This is an addition showing hospitalizations and deaths for vaccinated and 
		unvaccinated Californians per 100k people and per case. This is meant 
		to give you an idea about the danger level of getting covid over time. 
		<b>Note:</b> the per case metrics show deaths and hospitalizations per new case. 
		This may be a little misleading because if there is a sudden drop in cases, 
		it might look like there is a spike in mortality.
